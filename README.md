Medical store system management using file system in c
This is a Medical Store Management System developed using the C programming language with a focus on file systems. It was one of my early projects while learning how to manage data using files in C.


*Features*
1)Add new medicine details
2)Display available medicines
3)Search for a specific medicine
4)Edit existing medicine records
5)Delete medicine entries
6)Generate basic purchase bills


*How It Works*
All data is stored in a simple text file, simulating a basic database. File handling operations like fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), and fclose() are used to perform CRUD operations.


*Tools & Concepts Used*
C Programming Language
File Handling in C (.txt file as data storage)
Structures in C for data modeling
Console-based UI (simple terminal interface)
